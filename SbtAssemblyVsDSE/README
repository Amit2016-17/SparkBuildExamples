An example project for using Dse Analytics

This build file uses the sbt-assembly plugin so extra dependencies 
can be included with your application code.

The application looks for DSE in DSE_HOME
DSE_HOME should be the location such that DSE_HOME/bin/dse is a valid command

build the application with 

sbt assembly

then run it using

dse spark-submit target/scala-2.10/SbtVsDSE-assembly-1.0.jar
